# Excursion
> A web page which advertises a product called “Excursion”




## General Information
- I have built this landing page for my Codecademy Full-stack engineer course project assignment
- Idea behind this landing page: The web page we’ll build advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so we’ll use video and landscape imagery to set the scene.
-  A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.
